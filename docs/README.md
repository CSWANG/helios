Helios Documentation
--------------------

* [User Manual](user_manual.md) -- How to create and deploy jobs in a Helios cluster.
* [How To Deploy Helios](how_to_deploy.md) -- How to setup and install a Helios cluster.
* [Helios Testing Framework](testing_framework.md) -- How to write integration tests to spin up (dependent) containers so you can run tests against them.
* [Simplified Master Lookup](automatic_master_lookup.md) -- don't want to type `-z http://foo.bar:5801`, but rather something more like `-d prod` or `-d awsuse1` or `-d testing` to specify which cluster to connect to?  Then read this.
